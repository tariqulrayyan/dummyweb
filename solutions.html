    <h1>Some result and graph releated to water avialability challenges worldwide.</h1>
    <p>Drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, claiming an estimated 236,000 lives each year.<br><br>

        Over 90% of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with children under the age of five at highest risk.<br><br>
        
        CDC collaborates with the CDC Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies on global drowning work to confront this vast problem.<br><br>
        
        Bloomberg Philanthropies launched its Global Drowning Prevention Program in 2012. CDC, the CDC Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, 
        and other partners aim to adapt and improve local drowning prevention measures by collecting and analyzing data to understand the 
        specific causes of drowning.<br><br>
        In 2021, the World Health Organization declared July 25 each year as World Drowning Prevention Day, to highlight the tragic and 
        profound impact of drowning on families and communities and offer life-saving prevention strategies. This year, the WHO calls upon 
        individuals, organizations, and governments to “Do One Thing” to promote drowning prevention. In honor of that theme, the CDC Foundation 
        is recognizing World Drowning Prevention Day by sharing our collaborative work with Bloomberg Philanthropies, CDC, and in-country partners
         through the Understanding and Preventing Drowning in sub-Saharan Africa, which is establishing major milestones in global drowning prevention
          research in Uganda and Ghana.<br><br>Evidence-based prevention strategies like installing barriers around water sources, teaching water safety skills and implementing boating regulations have proven effective at preventing drowning. Before we can design, implement and monitor such strategies, it is crucial to understand the burden and circumstances surrounding drowning at a country level. However, with limited drowning data available in low- and middle-income countries, our understanding of contextual factors and impact of drowning is incomplete or misleading.

        ,<br><br> In 2018, the CDC Foundation and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with Makerere University School of Public Health researchers to identify fatal and non-fatal drowning cases in Uganda. Researchers collected administrative data from police offices, fire departments and mortuaries and conducted interviews with survivors, witnesses and family members for drowning cases that occurred between January 2016 and June 2018.
           This study found that in 12 of the 14 study districts, the drowning death rate was higher than the WHO African
            regional rate of 8.0 per 100,000 individuals.
          
          <br><br>Since 2020, the CDC Foundation and CDC have partnered with Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology 
          to understand the burden and circumstances of drowning in Ghana. The study aims to: (1) establish the availability
           of drowning data, (2) describe the burden of drowning including estimating a nationally representative drowning rate
          , the first in sub-Saharan Africa, and (3) describe the circumstances of drowning in Ghana. These data will help identify key 
           risk factors of drowning–such as the ages and sexes of victims, whether the incident was flood related and if there was a rescue
            attempt made by authorities or witnesses–to inform appropriate prevention and intervention strategies. Data collection for the
             study, which also examines the activity at time of drowning, life jacket use, swimming skills and boating-related information,
              will continue through December 2022.
          
          <br><br>Drowning is a preventable tragedy that 
          requires more global attention. By bolstering 
          data availability and establishing contextual
           understandings we can prevent thousands of lives 
           lost to drowning each year. To learn more about
            current global efforts to prevent drowning, visit 
            WHO’s World Drowning Prevention Day 2022 website.
            
            The CDC Foundation encourages you to take part
             in this year’s World Drowning Prevention Day 
             and identify the one thing you can do to help prevent drowning around the world.
